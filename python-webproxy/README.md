## HTTP Web Proxy Server in Python
Running this file in python hosts a local proxy server on the local computer with caching
To run, provide two arguments - IP address (as localhost) and port(any non system port number)
We can connect to the proxy by adding http://localhost:port in front of the url
This is a university project adapted from the book Kurose & Ross - Computer Networking
